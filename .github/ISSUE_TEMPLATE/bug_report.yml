        Provide relevant Homebridge logs, either pasted below or attached as a text file. Do NOT use a screenshot. Replace sensitive information (access tokens, etc) with `REDACTED`. Logs are most useful when they are complete; include the full output around the error message and do not omit any lines.

        Enable and capture appropriate extra debug:
        
        - **For Homebridge Debug Logging** (enable for most issues):
          - Launch Homebridge using `homebridge -D` to start in debug mode.
            - In Homebridge UI: *Settings* > *UI Advanced Settings* > *Log Settings* > *Enable/disable debug level logging*.
          - Or, in your `config.json`, add `"debug": ["Log Debug as Info"]` to log debug information as part of regular output.
            - In Homebridge UI: *Plugins* > *HomeConnect Plugin Config* > *General Settings* > *Debug Options* > *Log Debug as Info*.
          
        - **For Home Connect API Logging**:
          - In your `config.json`, add `"debug": ["Log API Bodies"]` to capture the raw API request and response bodies.
            - In Homebridge UI: *Plugins* > *HomeConnect Plugin Config* > *General Settings* > *Debug Options* > *Log API Bodies*.
          
        - **For HomeKit Accessory Protocol (HAP) Logging**:
          - Launch Homebridge using `DEBUG=HAP-NodeJS:* homebridge -D` to enable HAP-specific logging.
        
        The additional debug information in the logs will provide more context for resolving your issue.
      placeholder: |
        Paste the logs...

        With general debug:
          homebridge -D > debug.log

        With Home Connect API logging:
          { "platforms": [{ "platform": "HomeConnect", "debug": ["Log API Bodies"] }] }

        With HAP (HomeKit) logging:
          DEBUG=HAP-NodeJS:* homebridge -D > debug.log

        **Important Notes:**
        - Ensure all required fields are filled.
        - Debug logs (captured using `homebridge -D`) are crucial for resolving most issues.
        - Ensure sensitive information like tokens or passwords are `REDACTED` before sharing.
        - If you are not using the most recent plugin version, update before submitting.
