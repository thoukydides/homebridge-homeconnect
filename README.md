Home Connect home appliances plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge).

</div>

[Home Connect](https://www.home-connect.com), [Balay](https://www.balay.es/), [Bosch](https://www.bosch-home.com/), [Constructa](https://www.constructa.com/), [Gaggenau](https://www.gaggenau.com/), [NEFF](https://www.neff-home.com/), [Pitsos](https://www.pitsos.gr/), [Profilo](https://www.profilo.com/), [Siemens](https://www.siemens-home.bsh-group.com/), and [Thermador](https://www.thermador.com/), are trademarks of [BSH Home Appliances](https://www.bsh-group.com).

## Installation

### Step 1 - Setup Home Connect Appliances

1. Connect your home appliances with Home Connect:
   1. Install Home Connect from the Apple App Store for your country (e.g. [UK](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/home-connect-app/id901397789) or [USA](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/home-connect-america/id1134525430)).
   1. Create an account using your email address, click on the validation link in the email that will be received, and then return to the app and login.
   1. Connect the appliances to your home network, either via the app or using Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS).
   1. Connect the appliances to the app (by following the installation guide provided with the appliance).
1. If you are using a legacy Home Connect account then also create a [SingleKey ID](https://singlekey-id.com/en/sign-up/) using the same email address, ensuring that it is all in lowercase. Verify that the SingleKey ID works in the Home Connect app.

### Step 2 - Obtain a Home Connect Client ID

1. Sign-up for a free [Home Connect Developer Program](https://developer.home-connect.com/user/register) account and login.
1. [Register a new application](https://developer.home-connect.com/applications/add), ensuring that
   * *OAuth Flow* is set to **Device Flow**
   * *Home Connect User Account for Testing* is the same as the **SingleKey ID email address**
   * *Redirect URI* is **left blank**
   * *Enable One Time Token Mode* is **not ticked**
   * *Sync to China* is **ticked** if you are located within China, otherwise leave it **not ticked**
1. If the application is subsequently edited then additionally ensure that:
   * *Forces the usage of PKCE* is **not ticked**
   * *Status* is **Enabled**
   * *Client Secret Always Required* is **No**
1. Copy and save the displayed *Client ID*; it will be required to configure this plugin.
1. Wait 15 minutes for changes to the application to be deployed to the Home Connect authorisation servers.

### Step 3 - Homebridge Plugin Installation

#### Recommended approach using Homebridge UI

1. On the [Homebridge UI](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-config-ui-x) Plugins page search for and install the **HomeConnect** plugin.
1. Open the **HomeConnect** plugin settings and set the *Client ID* to the value obtained from the [Home Connect Developer Program](https://developer.home-connect.com/applications) for the created *Device Flow* application.
1. If you are located within China then set the *Server Location* to **China**, otherwise leave it as **Worldwide**.
1. Click on the *AUTHORISE* button to open a new Home Connect browser window. Login to your Home Connect account and approve access.
1. Save the plugin settings and restart Homebridge.

<summary>Alternative method using command line</summary>

#### Installation using Command Line

1. Install this plugin using: `npm install -g homebridge-homeconnect`
1. Edit `config.json` and add the HomeConnect platform (see example below).
1. Run (or restart) [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge).
1. The Homebridge log output will include an authorisation URL. Copy the listed URL into a web browser, login to your Home Connect account, and approve access.

#### Example `config.json`
```JSON
{
    "platforms":
    [{
        "platform":     "HomeConnect",
        "clientid":     "0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF"
    }]
}
```
The `clientid` should be set to the *Client ID* obtained from the [Home Connect Developer Program](https://developer.home-connect.com/applications) for the created *Device Flow* application.
</details>

Additional configuration is recommended to [customise the appliance programs](https://github.com/thoukydides/homebridge-homeconnect/wiki/Programs), and to select optional features. The easiest way to configure this plugin is via the [Homebridge UI](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-config-ui-x) configuration editor. This plugin implements a [custom user interface](https://developers.homebridge.io/#/custom-plugin-ui) that dynamically updates with the appropriate options for the connected appliances. Manual configuration via the [`config.json`](https://github.com/thoukydides/homebridge-homeconnect/wiki/config.json) file is possible, but not recommended.

## Appliance Support

This plugin supports most capabilities of the [Home Connect API](https://developer.home-connect.com/) that can be sensibly mapped to Apple-defined [HomeKit services and characteristics](https://github.com/thoukydides/homebridge-homeconnect/wiki/Functionality). More details can be found in the [functionality summary](https://github.com/thoukydides/homebridge-homeconnect/wiki/Functionality).

Apple's Home app does not support all of the features of this plugin. Some [third-party HomeKit apps](https://github.com/thoukydides/homebridge-homeconnect/wiki/HomeKit-Apps) are recommended due to their extra functionality.
